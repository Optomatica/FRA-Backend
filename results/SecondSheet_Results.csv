The details provided reflect essential compliance requirements for digital identity management.",None required.,"The management of NBFS-DigID is structured through the sub-processes of identification, verification, and authentication, each with specific controls and requirements. 

1. **Identification**: This process involves gathering user data, such as national ID and user ID. The requirements include collecting accurate identification information to ensure a reliable foundation for the subsequent processes.

2. **Verification**: In this phase, the system conducts identity validation, which includes ID scanning, liveness checks, and OTP verification. The control requirements documented here focus on confirming that the identity information provided matches the user's data securely and accurately.

3. **Authentication**: This sub-process is centered on establishing that the user is who they claim to be through mechanisms like OTPs. The specific controls involve ensuring that the authentication methods are robust, employ strong encryption, and are regularly tested for vulnerabilities.

Together, these sub-processes establish a comprehensive framework for managing digital identities securely through rigorous identification, verification, and authentication procedures.",0ef7e1ba-491b-48a2-9f03-edc9d5b20d7d; edc87a10-2155-4e98-8053-b0a1434c172b; 0f81d73f-2e2b-4ce4-bccc-f36725cad694; 83e7ff8e-95a1-4a61-8d6a-6a83ac707022; 63dbbc79-a495-4c1c-8db6-753f24ed4b99; 0640c22c-1f0a-45ad-9046-d5891fe03f08; 0b51a03d-7754-4e1f-af2c-b124d0e35560; ea4b7e29-61f0-40b0-a941-e0673ee57a90; c9c7f8f0-3006-4a72-8d26-734e1c2a6463; ceb227dc-7fa2-4d70-9162-f647f83ae030,1

2. **Creating a Digital ID**: Users are prompted to create a digital ID within the GateID system, ensuring that their identity is verified and secure.

3. **Data Matching**: GateID validates that the user data provided by the partner, such as user ID and national ID, matches the customer's confirmed identity data.

4. **Digital Signature Execution**: Once validation is successful, the user is notified of the contract, allowing them to digitally sign it directly through the GateID app.

5. **Contract Storage and Notification**: The signed contract is stored securely within the GateID system, and the partner is notified of the successful signing, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.
